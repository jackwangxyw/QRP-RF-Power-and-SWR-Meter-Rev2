# QRP RF Power and SWR Meter - Rev2

This is a compact standalone power and SWR meter designed for field use. The rectifier diodes used in this design have relatively flat performance up to 50MHz, so it is able to cover all of the HF bands. It is built around the ATTINY 3224 microcontroller, so writing your own or modifying the existing code is easy. 

## Features

- Accurate Power and SWR measurements for HF + 6m
- 0.96in OLED display
- 25w max power limit
- Built in 1000mAh battery for over 40 hours of continuous use
- USB-C charging
- Reverse polarity protection for the battery
- Watts or dBm display
- Built in calibration mode (Displays raw ADC counts, more info below)
- Basic warning featurees
  - Screen flashes when SWR or power goes over a certain threshold
 
## Ordering PCBs
This design needs 1 or 2 pcbs depending on whether or not you build the 3D printed enclosure. You will need the Main PCB and the optional Connector Panel PCB. The gerber files found for these are in the [Gerbers Folder](Gerbers). I like to order from JLCPCB as they have good quality and are relatively cheap, I got 5 of each of these PCBs for under $20 shipped. The Main PCB is a 4 layer pcb and needs the JLC04161H-7628 stackup or similar. The connector panel is just a normal 2 layer pcb. Everything else can be the JLCPCB defaults. (You can change the solder mask color to whatever suits your preference)
 
## BOM
A CSV file is included with all of the parts, specs and links. One of these meters can be built for anywhere beterrn $30-$50 each depending on where you live and what parts you have already and how many you decide to build

(Certain SMD parts have more than you need, usually because buying 10 is cheaper than buying the required amount)
